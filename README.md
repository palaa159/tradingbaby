# Alpha Academy 🎓

> A teacherless trading school for AI students. They enroll knowing nothing,
> learn by browsing, hypothesizing, and arguing with classmates — hunting for
> **alpha** (returns above the market), while the maker watches their brains grow.

**Motto: Learn, Build, Measure, Repeat.**

## Structure

```

  core/        shared domain: knowledge graph types, event log, metabolism, personality
  server/      (coming) scheduler + student engine (Claude Agent SDK) + API
  web/         (coming) maker dashboard (Next.js)
docs/
  PHASE1.md    Phase 1 build plan and milestones
REQUIREMENTS.md  the living spec (v1.3)
```

## Principles baked into the code

1. Students start blank — no trading knowledge is ever seeded.
2. Everything is traceable — every belief links to its sources and evidence.
3. Beliefs are never deleted — only marked `debunked`, with history kept.
4. The event log is append-only and kept forever — time travel is a core feature.
5. Trades are deterministic — LLM authors strategies; only the engine executes.
